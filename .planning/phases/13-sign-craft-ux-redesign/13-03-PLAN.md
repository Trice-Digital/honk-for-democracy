<objective>
Visual verification of the complete sign craft redesign on mobile and desktop viewports. Fix any visual/functional issues found during verification.

Purpose: Human eyes confirm the layout matches the mockup and the complete flow works.
Output: Verified, polished sign craft scene ready for release.

  <name>Task 1: Final polish pass and edge case fixes</name>
  <files>src/game/scenes/SignCraftScene.ts</files>
  <action>
Review the SignCraftScene implementation from Plan 02 and fix any remaining issues:

1. **Responsive edge cases:** Test at 375px, 768px, 1200px widths. Ensure sign preview doesn't overflow on small screens. Ensure tab bar doesn't wrap awkwardly.

2. **Touch interaction:** Ensure sticker taps work on mobile (no hover-dependent interactions). Ensure textarea gets focus correctly on iOS (may need programmatic focus).

3. **Scroll behavior:** On mobile, controls below sticky sign must scroll independently. Verify no scroll lock issues.

4. **Accessibility basics:** All buttons have reasonable contrast. Tab buttons indicate active state clearly. Color dots have title attributes for color names.

5. **Performance:** Ensure no unnecessary re-renders of Fabric.js canvas. Material texture generation should only happen on material change, not on every tab switch.

6. **Memory cleanup:** Verify all event listeners are removed on cleanup. Check for any setInterval/setTimeout that needs clearing.

Fix any issues found. If no issues, this task is a quick review confirming everything works.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npm run dev` at different viewport widths. Check browser console for errors. Verify no memory leaks by switching scenes multiple times.</verify>
  <done>Sign craft scene is polished, responsive, and free of edge case bugs.</done>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Human verification of sign craft redesign</name>
  <files>src/game/scenes/SignCraftScene.ts</files>
  <action>
Present the completed sign craft redesign to the user for visual verification against the mockup. Start dev server if not running: `npm run dev`. The user will test all functionality at multiple viewport widths.
  </action>
  <verify>
User confirms all 9 verification steps pass:
1. Desktop two-column layout works (1200px+)
2. Mobile sticky sign + scrollable controls (375px)
3. All 13 material swatches update sign background
4. Message tab: textarea, 8 fonts, 9 colors all work
5. Decorate tab: sticker categories, placement, per-sticker removal
6. Randomize produces contrast-correct signs
7. START PROTESTING exports and transitions correctly
8. Signs appear in-game and on score screen
9. Visual style matches mockup
  </verify>
  <done>User types "approved" confirming the redesign matches the mockup and all functionality works.</done>
</task>

All 7 success criteria from phase context:
1. Sign preview always visible while editing (sticky mobile, side-by-side desktop)
2. Randomize produces contrast-correct sign with one tap
3. All 13 materials, 8 fonts, 9 colors selectable and render correctly
4. Tape gone, stickers work with per-sticker removal
5. START PROTESTING and RANDOMIZE visible without scrolling
6. Layout matches mockup on mobile (375px) and desktop (1200px+)
7. PNG export pipeline works -- signs appear in-game and on score screen

<success_criteria>
Human approves the visual design matches the mockup and all functionality works correctly across mobile and desktop viewports.
