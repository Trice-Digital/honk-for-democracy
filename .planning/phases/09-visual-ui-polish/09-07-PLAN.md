<objective>
Reskin the landing page, score screen, and activism screen to match the Paper Mario Protest aesthetic.

Purpose: Every screen the player sees should feel like the same craft table. The landing page is the first impression. The score/activism screens are where sharing happens. Visual cohesion across ALL screens sells the aesthetic.

Output: Landing page with protest poster paper aesthetic, score scene with cardboard/marker styling, activism scene with paper treatment.

  <action>
Reskin the landing page to match Paper Mario Protest aesthetic. This is CSS-only — the HTML structure stays largely the same.

**Background:**
- Replace dark gradient with construction paper texture:
  - Base: warm off-white (#f5f0e8 — PALETTE paperWhite)
  - CSS: subtle paper grain using repeating-linear-gradient noise pattern or a procedural CSS background
  - Overall feel: craft table surface, not dark digital

**Hero title — styled as Scott's protest sign:**
- The design spec says: "Black board, white letters, HONK / FOR / DEMOCRACY each on its own line"
- Style the `<h1>` as a black board:
  - Background: #1a1a1a (marker black)
  - Text: #ffffff (white)
  - Padding: generous, like a real sign
  - Slight rotation (1-2 degrees) — like a sign pinned to a wall slightly crooked
  - Hard offset shadow (4px right, 4px down, rgba(0,0,0,0.4)) — paper cutout on table
  - Scissor-cut border: slightly irregular border using `border-image` with a subtle noise, OR just a 3px solid black border

- HONK in large bold, FOR in smaller weight, DEMOCRACY in large bold
- Font: Bangers (already loaded via Google Fonts for sign creator)
  - Add the Google Fonts `<link>` in the head if not already there

**CTA button — neobrutalist:**
- Background: #fbbf24 (safety yellow)
- Text: #1a1a1a (marker black), bold
- Border: 3px solid #1a1a1a
- Shadow: 4px 4px 0 #1a1a1a (hard, no blur — neobrutalist offset shadow)
- On hover: translate 2px right, 2px down, reduce shadow to 2px (press into shadow)
- Border-radius: 4px (barely rounded, chunky)
- Text: "STAND UP" (per design spec, not "PLAY NOW")

**Badge ("A PROTEST SIMULATOR"):**
- Style as masking tape strip: off-white background, slightly rotated, irregular edges
- Or style as a stamp/stencil: red ink on paper look

**Steps section:**
- Step numbers in paper cutout circles with drop shadows
- Step labels in Bangers font
- Arrow between steps as hand-drawn marker arrows (or just use colored arrows)

**Footer:**
- Simple, paper-colored, marker font for "honkfordemocracy.org"

**Color overhaul:**
- Replace all blue/yellow from current dark theme with Paper Mario Protest palette colors
- Primary accent: safety yellow on dark surfaces, marker black on light surfaces
- Links/interactive: action blue

**ScoreScene.ts — paper craft reskin:**

Import PALETTE from paletteConfig and paperArt utilities.

1. **Background:** Change from `#0f0f1a` to `PALETTE.cardboard` (warm cardboard tan)
   - Add paper grain overlay (like intersection scene)

2. **Title:** Use Bangers font, PALETTE.safetyYellow on dark stroke

3. **Score display:**
   - Grade badge: paper cutout circle with drop shadow and scissor-cut edge
   - Score number: Bangers font, PALETTE.safetyYellow

4. **Stats grid:**
   - Draw on a paper cutout panel (lighter cardboard rectangle with scissor edges and drop shadow)
   - Labels: marker font
   - Dividers: masking tape strips instead of gray lines

5. **Reaction breakdown:**
   - Each reaction count in a small paper badge/bubble

6. **Buttons:**
   - Neobrutalist style: hard offset shadow, thick border, press-into-shadow on click
   - "Continue" button: PALETTE.actionBlue
   - "Play Again": lighter, secondary style

**ActivismScene.ts — paper craft reskin:**

Import PALETTE from paletteConfig.

1. **Background:** Change from `#0a0a12` to a warm paper tone (slightly darker than cardboard, like kraft paper — `#8b7355`)

2. **Hero text:** Bangers font
   - "This was a game." in PALETTE.paperWhite
   - "This is also real." in PALETTE.safetyYellow

3. **Resource buttons:**
   - Paper cutout rectangles with scissor-cut edges and drop shadows
   - Colored left accent bars (keep existing color logic)
   - Marker-font labels

4. **Play Again button:** Neobrutalist style

**Sign Creator visual polish (src/pages/index.astro or sign creator component):**
- Add subtle paper texture CSS to the sign creator editor background (the Fabric.js canvas container)
  - `background: #f5f0e8; background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,...")` with a subtle noise pattern
  - OR use the same repeating-linear-gradient paper grain as the landing page
- Add a scissor-cut border around the canvas area:
  - 3px dashed or wavy border in `#1a1a1a`
  - Slight rotation (0.5 degrees) on the canvas container for "pinned to craft table" feel
- This is CSS-only polish — do NOT rebuild any sign creator functionality

**For both Phaser scenes:**
- All font changes: set fontFamily to `'Bangers', cursive`
- All colors: reference PALETTE constants where possible
- Add drop shadows to major UI panels

**IMPORTANT font note:** `Bangers` is the UI font (chunky, bold, game-feel). It must be loaded via Google Fonts CDN `<link>` in `index.astro` head AND preloaded for Phaser scenes. Add both Bangers AND Permanent Marker (for sign creator) to the Google Fonts link. Phaser text needs the font loaded before scene creation.
